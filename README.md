# Hello world!

This is my trial of the [GitHub hello-world tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

I might also temporarily store things here.

My work will mostly involve: 
1) **Data analysis using R**: my colleague, [Sahir Bhatnagar](http://sahirbhatnagar.com/), wrote a [tutorial on how to use RStudio and GitHub](https://plot.ly/r/github-getting-started-for-data-scientists/) together.

2) **Writing papers**: I still haven't found what I'm looking for....but I am considering [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/users/4920) for collaborative writing if I can convince my thesis committee members and co-authors it is secure and worth the initial learning efforts. 

3) **Online tutorials and practice-of-epidemiology curation**: hopefully...[Nandini Dendukuri](http://www.nandinidendukuri.com/) and I started such a project---[POCTcalibration](http://tanyamurphy.github.io/poctcalibration/)---but it's been neglected since I started my PhD (who knew that could be so time-consuming!)
