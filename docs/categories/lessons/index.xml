      <description>Khan Academy&amp;rsquo;s computer programming lessons aren&amp;rsquo;t just for kids I love Khan Academy! I love what Khan Academy does so much that I&amp;rsquo;m not shy to say that I&amp;mdash;a university educated adult&amp;mdash;use it for reviewing math and learning new things.
I encourage my children to use it during the summer to review math (which they love and often want to work ahead in) and English grammar (they are in French school where the English classes do not keep them at their English school equivalency).</description>
