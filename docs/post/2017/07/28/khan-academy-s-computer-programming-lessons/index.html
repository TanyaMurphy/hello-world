<p>I love <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>! I love what Khan Academy does so much that I&rsquo;m not shy to say that I&mdash;a university educated adult&mdash;use it for reviewing math and learning new things.</p>

<p>I encourage my children to use it during the summer to review math (which they love and often want to work ahead in) and English grammar (they are in French school where the English classes do not keep them at their English school equivalency).</p>

<p>They wanted to try something new, however, and tried the coding lessons. I didn&rsquo;t have high expectations because we had tried <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/25009835/">Scratch</a> last summer, but it didn&rsquo;t grab them. They&rsquo;re loving the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS lessons</a>. Well, one is still loving it beyond the early, quick-results lessons. It reminds me of his passion for assembling new Lego or Mechano sets. The other one has grown tired of the JS lessons, but likes the idea of starting a blog (also characteristic of his play style&mdash;more on that another time).</p>

<p>To stay one step ahead of my young JavaScript enthusiast, I started the lessons, too. I hadn&rsquo;t seriously considered doing them in the past despite feeling some basic knowledge of JS would help me with work. The lessons seemed too oriented toward animation and games, which I didn&rsquo;t think would be an efficient way of learning JS for data science web apps.</p>

<p>The lessons have turned out to be a great introduction to the basic concepts. The HTML and CSS have also been a nice for completing the <em>ad hoc</em> basics I&rsquo;ve picked up over the years. Lessons aimed at beginner adults would probably be more efficient, but when I&rsquo;m trying to get some professional development done while being at home with my kids for the summer, Khan Academy lessons have been a great compromise. I&rsquo;m making some real progress, the lessons are designed as clear, short modules so interruptions (so frequent!) are not disruptive, and (I think) I&rsquo;m showing them the lessons that I&rsquo;m asking them to do are legit.</p>

<p>The rubber really hit the road for me when I got to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/js-and-the-dom/p/the-dom-document-object-model">The DOM lesson</a>. I&rsquo;ll be posting my little project soon.</p>
