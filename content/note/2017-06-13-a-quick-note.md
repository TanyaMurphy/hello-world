To me, the two most impressive websites based on **blogdown** are:

1. [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com)'s personal website.
1. [Live Free or Dichotomize](http://livefreeordichotomize.com) by Lucy and Nick _et al_.

I'm sure there will be more.

[An awesome tutorial](https://apreshill.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) on **blogdown** written by Alison. I have to admit this is _the_ best **blogdown** tutorial I have seen so far.
